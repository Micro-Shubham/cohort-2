// Enums (short for enumerations) in TypeScript are a feature that allows you to define a set of named constants.
// The concept behind an enumeration is to create a human-readable way to represent a set of constant values, which might otherwise be represented as numbers or strings
//Example 1 - Game 
// Letâ€™s say you have a game where you have to perform an action based on weather the user has pressed the up arrow key, down arrow key, left arrow key or right arrow key.

// one way to tell that it should string but only run when 
// keypressed is up , down , right, left
type keyinput = "up" | "down" | "right" | "left"

function doSomething(keyPressed:keyinput) {
    // do something
}

doSomething("up")
doSomething("down")
// if i try to key any random string ts will throw error 
// doSomething("sdfjasdj")
